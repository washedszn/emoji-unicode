# Emoji Unicode Regular Expression

Scrapes all emojis from [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/), then creates a regular expression which contains all of the emojis unicodes, in the shortest way possible.

### IMPORTANT:

The format function is currently built to return a Golang regular expression, due to personal uses. Will add Javascript functionality soon, as well as other languages if needed.
